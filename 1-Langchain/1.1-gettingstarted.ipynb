AgentRelease policySecurity PolicyIntroductionOn this pageIntroduction\\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).\\nLangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:\\n\\nDevelopment: Build your applications using LangChain\\'s open-source components and third-party integrations.\\nUse LangGraph to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.\\nProductionization: Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your applications, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.\\nDeployment: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with LangGraph Platform.\\n\\n\\n\\nLangChain implements a standard interface for large language models and related\\ntechnologies, such as embedding models and vector stores, and integrates with\\nhundreds of providers.

Read more in the\\nArchitecture page.\\n\\nlangchain-core: Base abstractions for chat models and other components.\\nIntegration packages (e.g. langchain-openai, langchain-anthropic, etc.): Important integrations have been split into lightweight packages that are co-maintained by the LangChain team and the integration developers.\\nlangchain: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application\\'s cognitive architecture.\\nlangchain-community: Third-party integrations that are community maintained.\\nlanggraph: Orchestration framework for combining LangChain components into production-ready applications with persistence, streaming, and other key features.
